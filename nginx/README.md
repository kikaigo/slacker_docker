nginx
====

A base nginx container for use with octohost.

Use this container as a starting point to deploy static HTML to an octohost.

To use an already built container:

`docker pull octohost/nginx:1.8`

Or you can build it from this source:

`docker build -t your-organization/nginx:1.8`

For a working example, please take a look at the [HTML](https://github.com/octohost/html)
